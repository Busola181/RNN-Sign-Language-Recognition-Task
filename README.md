# Sequence Models Projects: Image Captioning, Sentiment Analysis, Neural Machine Translation, and Letter Text Generation

This repository contains projects that implement sequence models like RNNs, LSTMs, and attention mechanisms for tasks such as **image captioning**, **sentiment analysis**, **neural machine translation (NMT)**, and **letter text generation**.

## Overview

These projects demonstrate the application of sequence models in four different areas:
- **Image Captioning**: Generating captions for images by using a CNN-LSTM model architecture.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifying the sentiment of text using LSTM-based models.
- **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)**: Translating text from one language to another using sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms.
- **Letter Text Generation**: Automatically generating human-like text for letter writing or other formal texts using RNN or LSTM models.

All projects leverage sequence models, such as RNNs and LSTMs, and explore attention mechanisms where applicable to improve performance on sequence-based tasks.

## Introduction

This repository focuses on four key tasks in the field of deep learning:
1. **Image Captioning**: Generating captions that describe the content of an image. This is done using CNNs for feature extraction and LSTMs for generating the captions.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the sentiment of textual data (positive or negative) using LSTM-based models to learn from sequential data.
3. **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)**: Translating text from one language to another using encoder-decoder models with attention mechanisms.
4. **Letter Text Generation**: Generating formal text or letters using RNNs or LSTMs, allowing for automatic letter writing based on input prompts.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Image Captioning
- **Description**: This project uses a CNN as an encoder to extract features from an image and an LSTM as a decoder to generate captions based on these features.
- **Data**: Flickr8k image dataset, containing images with associated captions.
- **Model**: A hybrid architecture of a CNN (encoder) + LSTM (decoder).

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- **Description**: This project applies LSTM-based models to predict the sentiment (positive/negative) of a given text.
- **Data**: IMDB movie reviews dataset.
- **Model**: LSTM model trained to analyze the sentiment of text sequences.

### 3. Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
- **Description**: This project focuses on translating text from one language to another using sequence-to-sequence models, specifically an encoder-decoder model with an attention mechanism.
- **Data**: Parallel corpus dataset, such as English-French sentence pairs.
- **Model**: RNN/LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence model with attention.

### 4. Letter Text Generation
- **Description**: This project involves generating formal text, such as letters or emails, using RNN or LSTM models trained on large text corpora. The model takes a prompt and continues generating human-like text, suitable for letter writing or similar tasks.
- **Data**: A large dataset of formal letters or email text data.
- **Model**: An LSTM-based language model trained to generate letter-like text.

## Installation and Setup

To run these projects, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries such as PyTorch, Numpy, and others listed in the `requirements.txt`.

### Steps:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SeqModel-Projects.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

### Image Captioning:
1. Run the script or notebook in the `ImageCaptioning` directory.
2. Use the model to input an image and generate a caption.

### Sentiment Analysis:
1. Open the notebook in the `SentimentAnalysis` directory.
2. Train the model or load pre-trained weights and evaluate the sentiment of text samples.

### Neural Machine Translation (NMT):
1. Navigate to the `NeuralMachineTranslation` folder.
2. Run the script or notebook to train the sequence-to-sequence model with an attention mechanism.
3. Provide input text (e.g., an English sentence) and receive the translated output in the target language (e.g., French).

### Letter Text Generation:
1. Go to the `LetterTextGeneration` folder.
2. Run the LSTM-based text generation script to produce formal letter text.
3. Provide an input prompt (e.g., a greeting or opening sentence), and the model will generate the rest of the letter.
